# Beginner-Games
These are games that a beginner to coding can make (such as myself), and are designed by a beginner -- as such they will definitely have errors with efficiency and length. However, they can be a good inspiration for projects to work on.

# Improvements to Make
1. Number Guesser Genie:
  - Decreasing the number of lines (use more efficient loops and conditional statements).
  - Adding an element of randomness to the guessing (such as randomly guessing the lower bound) in order to make it seem like     an actual person guessing. 
  - Splitting it into multiple functions and perhaps consolidating them into header and source files to make the main function     a lot cleaner.
  - More efficient ways to guess the number itself --> keep dividing and multiplying by 2 could be made more efficient to aid     with runtime and allow the game to be played with larger numbers a little quicker.
  - Adding commas to the number outputs to make it easier to read and play with longer integers.
